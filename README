Draw Prediction Tool

I’m just a guy with a big dream.

This project is a personal attempt to build a solid and intelligent website focused on predicting football draw matches using statistical and mathematical models.

For now, the main focus is draw predictions, done carefully using multiple probability-based methods and real match inputs. The goal is to keep improving accuracy, structure, and confidence over time.

In the future, I plan to expand this project by adding more prediction types and advanced mathematical models, but for now, draws are the priority.

This is a work in progress — learning, building, and improving step by step.

Thank you for checking it out.
